Hi, I'm Isha! I'm currently a senior at Harvard University studying Applied Math - Computer Science with a minor in Statistics. I work in <a href = "https://himalakkaraju.github.io/">  Professor Hima Lakkaraju's lab, AI4LIFE</a>, and previously spent 1.5 years at <a href = "https://research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence"> IBM Research AI</a>. 
<br><br>
My work has been published at venues such as NeurIPS and has been awarded the ACM Cutler Bell Prize for Excellence in Computing, NCWIT Collegiate Award, and Davidson Fellowship, among others. 
<br><br>
I'm broadly interested in natural language understanding, reasoning, and causal inference, as well as interpretable and explainable AI techniques.
<br><br>

I currently serve as a: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href = "https://www.alumni.hbs.edu/stories/Pages/story-bulletin.aspx?num=6948">Harvard Technology Innovation Fellow</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Co-President of <a href = "https://www.harvardwics.com/">Harvard Women in CS</a>, a position where I was elected to lead a board of 40 and run almost 100 yearly academic, mentorship, career, and community events for hundreds of students
    </li>
    <li>
        Teaching Fellow for <a href = "https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/110613"> Harvard's Applied Mathematics 120 – Linear Algebra for Big Data </a>since 2020, efforts for which I've won Harvard's Derek Bok Award for Excellence in Teaching
    </li>
</ul>

<br>
My email is ishapuri [at] college [dot] harvard [dot] edu. I'd love to hear from you!

<summary><h2>Personal Things! </h2></summary>
Outside of research, I:  
<ul>
    <li> play the harp! I've recently been getting into playing <a href = "https://ishapuri.github.io/harp.html">harp adaptions of Bollywood</a> and Disney songs : )   </li>

    <li> am obsessed with learning about history - when I was little, my parents thought I would grow up to be a historian. I can spend hours going down Wikipeida wormholes of famous historical figures or time periods - ask me about the Gilded Age! </li>

    <li> am really enjoying taking a bunch of social science courses this semester - I took a course on the Psychology of Communication (and wrote a cool <a href = "/assets/pdfs/No Laughing Matter_ A Proposal for Analyzing Human Reactions to AI-Generated Communication.pdf">final research paper</a> on human responses to GPT-generated humor) and Chinese Political Economics (some <a href = "/assets/pdfs/EC 1133 - Grumble At Your Own Risk - Complaints and Public Information Flow Within the Communist Party.pdf">more</a> <a href = "/assets/pdfs/EC 1133 - Power Chip - the US-China Technology Trade War.pdf">cool</a> papers I wrote!) </li>

    <li> am *obsessed* with late night comedy - I've seen several live tapings of every late night show except Trevor Noah, who I've seen on tour twice! My multiverse dream would be to intern for The Late Show, Last Week Tonight, or The Daily Show for a summer.</li>

    <li> collect postcards! I've been assembling my treasured <a href = "https://ishapuri.github.io/postcard_wall.html">postcard wall</a> since I was 15. It now has nearly 600 postcards - each inscribed with the date, a short story from the day, and signatures of who was there! </li>
