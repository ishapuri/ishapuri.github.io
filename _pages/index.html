Hi, I'm Isha! I'm currently a senior at Harvard University studying Applied Math - Computer Science with a minor in Statistics. I work in <a href = "https://himalakkaraju.github.io/"> the AI4LIFE Professor Hima Lakkaraju's lab</a>, and previously spent 1.5 years at <a href = "https://research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence"> IBM Research AI</a>. 
<br><br>
My work has been published at venues such as NeurIPS and has been awarded the ACM Cutler Bell Prize for Excellence in Computing, among others. 
<br><br>

I'm broadly interested in interpretable and explainable AI techniques and Natural Language Processing, Reasoning, and Causal Inference. 

<br><br>

I currently serve as Co-President of <a href = "https://www.harvardwics.com/">Harvard Women in CS</a>. 
I've also served as a Teaching Fellow for Harvard's Applied Mathematics 120 – Linear Algebra for Big Data since 2020, efforts for which I've won Harvard's Derek Bok Prize for Excellence in Teaching. 

<br><br>


My email is ishapuri [at] college [dot] harvard [dot] edu. I'd love to hear from you!
