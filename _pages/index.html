Hi, I'm Isha! I'm a PhD student at <a href = "https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/?category=Groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT CSAIL</a> working on reasoning in lanaguage models, generative AI, and machine learning. I'm lucky to be coadvised by <a href = "https://people.csail.mit.edu/yoonkim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Professor Yoon Kim</a> and <a href = "https://healthyml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Professor Marzyeh Ghassemi</a>. My PhD is funded by MIT's Great Educators Fellowship and the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship. 
<br><br>

I graduated from Harvard University in 2023 with a B.A. in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I worked in Professor Hima Lakkaraju's lab, <a href = "https://himalakkaraju.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI4LIFE</a>, and previously spent 1.5 years at <a href = "https://research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> IBM Research AI</a>. 
<br><br>
My work has been published at venues such as NeurIPS and has been awarded the ACM Cutler Bell Prize for Excellence in Computing, NCWIT Collegiate Award, and Davidson Fellowship, among others. 
<br><br>
I'm very interested in natural language understanding, reasoning, and causal inference, as well as interpretable and explainable AI techniques.
<br><br>

In college, I was lucky to serve as: 
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href = "https://www.hbs.edu/mba/roberts-family-fellows/Pages/default.aspx target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"">Harvard Business School (HBS) Technology Innovation Fellow</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Co-President of <a href = "https://www.harvardwics.com/ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"">Harvard Women in CS</a>, a position where I was elected to lead a board of 40 and run almost 100 yearly academic, mentorship, career, and community events for hundreds of students
    </li>
    <li>
        Teaching Fellow for <a href = "https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/110613 target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer""> Harvard's Applied Mathematics 120 – Linear Algebra for Big Data </a>since 2020, efforts for which I've won Harvard's Derek Bok Award for Excellence in Teaching
    </li>
</ul>

<br>
My email is ishapuri [at] mit [dot] edu. I'd love to hear from you!

<summary><h2>Personal Things! </h2></summary>
Outside of research, I:  
<ul>
    <li> play the harp! I've recently been getting into playing <a href = "https://ishapuri.github.io/harp.html">harp adaptions of Bollywood</a> and Disney songs : )   </li>

    <li> love learning about history - when I was little, my parents thought I would grow up to be a historian. I can spend hours going down Wikipeida wormholes of famous historical figures or time periods - some of my favorites right now are the Gilded Age and the WWII Science Industrial Age!</li>

    <li> really enjoying taking social science courses - I took a course on the Psychology of Communication (and wrote a cool <a href = "/assets/pdfs/No Laughing Matter_ A Proposal for Analyzing Human Reactions to AI-Generated Communication.pdf">final research paper</a> on human responses to GPT-generated humor) and Chinese Political Economics (some <a href = "/assets/pdfs/EC 1133 - Grumble At Your Own Risk - Complaints and Public Information Flow Within the Communist Party.pdf">more</a> <a href = "/assets/pdfs/EC 1133 - Power Chip - the US-China Technology Trade War.pdf">cool</a> papers I wrote!) </li>

    <li>  *love* with late night comedy - I've seen several live tapings of every late night show except Trevor Noah, who I've seen on tour twice! My multiverse dream would be to intern for The Late Show, Last Week Tonight, or The Daily Show for a summer.</li>

    <li> collect postcards! I've been assembling my treasured <a href = "https://ishapuri.github.io/postcard_wall.html">postcard wall</a> since I was 15. It now has nearly 650 postcards - each inscribed with the date, a short story from the day, and signatures of who was there! </li>
